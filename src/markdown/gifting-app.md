You can record anything someone has given in a provable way: [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) is a standard to cryptographically sign claims and assertions, and some of the data is publicly recorded at [EndorserSearch.org](https://endorsersearch.org). (Your ID is invisible to everyone except those in the network you create with the app.)

Download the mobile app from [EndorserSearch.org](https://endorsersearch.org) recognize others... and maybe get some love in return. Start with the easy things, like the time they spent with you recently. We want to magnify the little things -- those things that are actually the most important.

FYI: we are building a version that is much easier to use, and you are welcome to help us.
