Go to [TimeSafari.app](https://timesafari.app), get the person who introduced you to register you, and recognize what others have given you. Start with the easy things, like the time they spent with you recently. We want to magnify the little things -- those regular activities that are actually the most impactful.

For more powerful features, you can use the mobile app from [EndorserSearch.org](https://endorsersearch.org).

These apps enable you to record these claims in a provable way: [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) is a standard to cryptographically sign claims and assertions, and some of the data is publicly recorded at [EndorserSearch.org](https://endorsersearch.org). (Your ID is invisible to everyone except those in the network you create with the app -- and, for now, the ID is stored on the server but we are working on a better design.)
