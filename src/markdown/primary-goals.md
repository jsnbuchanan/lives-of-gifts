See our [overall plans](https://observablehq.com/d/83a90a6d6cd11999?loadTaskUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trentlarson/lives-of-gifts/master/project.task.yaml). We are working on more [progress metrics and tracking](/progress) (just because it's fun).

We are also a part of the following initiatives under development.

* Voluntary Gifts & Governance

  - [Endorser Search](https://EndorserSearch.org) is a proof-of-concept to propose projects, donate time to friends, & start evolving good governance voluntarily. Help develop it more, or help with [a more user-friendly version](https://gitea.anomalistdesign.com/trent_larson/kick-starter-for-time-pwa).

  - [ShareBay](https://sharebay.org) aims to build a giving society. Help us develop it more.

* Basic Sustenance

  - [Terraculture Project](https://www.terracultureproject.org/) demonstrates healthy ways of living with minimal effort, as naturally as possible. Building has begun and we'd love to have you join us.
