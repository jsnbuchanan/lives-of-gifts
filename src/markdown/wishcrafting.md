Bring the project you'd like to see come to life, no matter how impractical at the time (and also no matter how small compared to what you see on Instagram). It's like a business pitch competition but for efforts that are sustained by passion (and optionally by money), and where you don't really have all the answers, or even all the questions. BTW, the goal is just as much to inspire and encourage the non-presenters in the group... everyone should be uplifted.

- Prepare.
  - Each meeting has 2-3 presentations, announced ahead of time. We expect to see effort put into explaining the Plans. Each is personal-invite-only.

- Present Plans for 5-15 minutes.
  - Start with the Dream, Motivation, Passion... the Reasons for your Plan.
  - Explain your Plan. This is the meat. It can be at any level of definition, but aim to end with what you think are the next concrete actions or goals.
  - If you have an invite for others to participate, aim to have concrete things they can do independently.

- Catch questions for 15-20 minutes (for a total of about 30 minutes, possibly flexible based on other time allowances/constraints).
  - Anyone can ask questions and give advice.
  - Brainstorms are encouraged. Consider alternative problem statements, timelines, audiences, invites, and even Dreams.

Other Recommendations
- A group of 4-5 is most desirable, to allow variety but also to allow a few minutes for each participant to get into good questions.
- A moderator is recommended, if only to call out when 30 minutes have passed. Mature moderators can be helpful to help ask even better questions to prompt discussion or to help redirect to other participants to ensure broad input.
