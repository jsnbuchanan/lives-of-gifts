Capabilities grow over time.

### Have time?

- Consider who could use a text or a phone call right now.

- Look for events that you enjoy and go ask how you can help.

- We could use help advertising, and also soliciting sponsorships.

### Have expertise?

- Do an online search for that hobby, even in your area... you may be surprised. If not, consider creating some posts or videos about it, and you'll attract others.

- If you've got friends, ask them what kind of sharing would be fun.

- Come share at one of our events, or let us show you how to start your own.

### Have money?

- I have a feeling you have no shortage of opportunities, but the ideas above might connect you with true inspiration.

- Challenge grants are available in every domain you want to grow, and that brings even more participation.

- Let's talk about impact via experiences.
