Capabilities grow over time.

## Have time?

- Consider who could use a text or a phone call right now.

- Look for events that you enjoy and go ask how you can help.

- We could use help advertising, and also soliciting sponsorships.

## Have expertise?

- Do an online search for that hobby, even in your area... you may be surprised. If not, consider creating some posts or videos about it, and you'll attract others.

- If you've got friends, ask them what kind of sharing would be fun.

- Come share at one of our events, or let us show you how to start your own.

### ... in programming?

- If you are interested in building gifting platforms in a self-sovereign way, we have a lot to discuss because we have some MVPs and big plans.

### ... in economics?

- Help us research & publish about widespread, debt-free living.

## Have money?

- I have a feeling you have no shortage of opportunities, but the ideas above might give some inspiration.

- Challenge grants are available in every domain you want to grow, and that brings even more participation.

- For more help on real impact via experiences, feel free to contact us.
