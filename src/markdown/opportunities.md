Capabilities grow over time.

## Have time?

- Consider who could use a text or a phone call right now.

- Look for events that you enjoy and go ask how you can help.

- We could use help advertising, and also soliciting sponsorships.

## Have expertise?

- Do an online search for that hobby, even in your area... you may be surprised.
  If not, consider creating some posts or videos about it on your favorite
  platform, and you'll attract others.

- If you've got friends, ask them what kind of sharing would be fun.

- Come share at one of our events, or let us show you how to start your own.

### ... in programming?

- If you are interested in building gifting platforms in a self-sovereign way,
  we have a lot to discuss because we have some MVPs and big plans.

### ... in economics?

- Help us research & publish about widespread, debt-free living.

## Have money?

- Money is easy to give: be sure to consider both short- and long-term
  consequences, and both local and global contexts That way you gain a balance
  of deep & close relationships alongside the benefits of wider but more shallow
  impact.

- We expect to grow meaningful collaboration, so contact us for real impact via
  experiences. Just realize we will always value the benefit to future
  generations above pure monetary payback.
