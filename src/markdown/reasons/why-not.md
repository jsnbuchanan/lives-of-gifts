"We need money!"

* Wrong. Money is an efficient measurement that has brought us great innovations
  & improvements rapidly, but it is hardly a necessity. How many farmers and
  builders would just never work again if everything was provided for them? Of
  course people would work, and we would not die. People just wouldn't be pushed
  to work -- unless they drove themselves, which most of us do anyway. If we had
  already started along this path, we would be much more fulfilled... we would
  not be as prosperous as we are now, but we'd get here eventually, anyway.

* Oh, and see David Graeber's research on the real origins of money.

"There would be freeloaders."

* Yep.

"No, seriously: the freeloaders would drag down everyone else."

* Nope. That only happens when producers have less of a spirit of charity and
  have more of a sense of jealousy or greed in their lives. There is a valid
  argument against giving children everything they want; there is no valid
  argument against giving children and everyone else in the world everything
  they need to survive.

"No, you're still missing the point: the freeloaders will take more than they deserve, often violently."

* Only if the culture has an unbalanced value of material goods or forceful
  activities. Even if you judge today's world to be that sort of culture, the
  majority of violence and theft are reactionary in nature, in rebellion against
  unfair systems. We can overcome with a better culture.

"If we give everything away, we'll end up with nothing."

* There is definitely a range of effective and ineffective giving. There is no
  reason to give everything to the point where your own livelihood is at risk.
  The volition of the giver is paramount to any gift.

"Nobody will choose live this way."

* Look up "gifting economies", "intentional communities", "off-the-grid" and
  "self-reliant" living, and "homesteads".

"Only a few folks on the fringe would do this. The vast majority of the world will choose to participate in the monetary market economy."

* That's true for now, in the year 2020, because that's the focus of the
  dominant power structures. But once we demonstrate the life-affirming
  practices of a non-monetary society, more will be attracted.

"This lifestyle would not survive because the existing power structures require money to work collectively."

* If you're talking banks and military might, this is true today, and many of us
  cannot wait to starve them out; large-scale operations do more to serve the
  egos and lifestyles of authoritarians than to actually serve people. If you're
  talking about governance of limited goods (like water & land), see Elinor
  Ostrom's work showing how collective ownership has worked.

"This is practical inside a community, but gifting breaks down in between tribes."

* This is a better argument but it is the same issue, so again we point to
  Elinor Ostrom's research.

"Although sharing common resources is possible, there is always the threat of a
powerful nation-state to take over so it is necessary to support a military by
taxes and by force."

* Immoral (or misguided) ambitions are a threat, but an internal, centralized
  military power are just as much a threat to prosperity... and maybe more of a
  threat to basic humanity. Dedicated, decentralized defenses have worked in the
  past for the American Colonies, and more recently for the nations of Vietnam
  and Afghanistan, showing that a dedicated citizenry can chase off even top
  world superpowers; there are many counter-examples, but it's very possible.

"You're dreaming! The world today proves the inevitable supremacy of large, forceful nation-states."

* Our history demonstrates the power and widespread attraction of a particular mindset; however, it also happened in a particular world and time frame, and we're in a different world now where information is now much more widespread. Lies and improper authoritarianism are more difficult to cloak. This will lead to a realization that all people are equally worthy to make their own life choices... so those of us today who can give, will give as much as we can for the benefit of one another and of future generations.

* We're building human-oriented society. The only way to get there is through application of the best moral compass imaginable.
