Because it's fulfilling!

* Need we say more?

Because it will change the economics of the world around you.

* This isn't a platitude. We are surrounded by companies and individuals who
  strive to build monetarily sustainable businesses, so we often forget that
  there are other measurable goals and other organizational principles. Many of
  us are able to apply our means toward endeavors beyond just sustaining lives,
  and if we dedicate more of that to gifts for our future then the next
  generation will have even more time and space to give to their progeny, and so
  on. Pioneers and artists invested such that their gifts last long beyond their
  lifespan, and there is no reason every one of us cannot do the same.

* Grasp the full power of that proposition: we can evolve to a point where
  everything we need is freely given, and almost everyone can find ways to
  fulfill their life's desires based on these principles (the only exeptions to
  that rule being people whose life's desires are authority over other people or
  absolute unreasonable command over resources).

* Let's evolve.
