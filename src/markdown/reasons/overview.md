Because it's rewarding!

* Enough said.

Because it will actually change world economics.

* This isn't a platitude. We are surrounded by companies and individuals who
  strive to build economically viable businesses, so we often forget that there
  are other goals and other ways to attain good lives. Many of us are able to
  apply our means toward endeavors beyond just sustaining lives, and if we
  dedicate more of that to gifts for our future then the next generation will
  have even more time and space to give to their progeny, and so on. Pioneers
  and artists invested such that their gifts last long beyond their lifespan,
  and there is no reason every one of us cannot do the same.
