Because it's rewarding!

* Enough said.

Because it actually can change world economics.

* This isn't a platitude. We are surrounded by companies and individuals who
  strive to build economically viable businesses, so we often forget that there
  are other goals and other ways to attain good lives. Many of us have the means
  to apply to endeavors beyond just sustaining our lives, and if we dedicate
  more of that to gifts for our future then the next generation will have even
  more time and space to give to their progeny, and so on.

* The big institutions
  have learned to invest such that they survive beyond their founders, so let's
  do the same for fellow humans.
