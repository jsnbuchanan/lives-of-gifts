title: About This Focus
---

### The goal is audacious: ###

Let's make this whole world one of cooperation and loving-kindness. We want this
for everyone, not just for our ourselves or our families or our immediate
communities. We can bring a real change of heart and focus for the majority of
the world: whereas most currently live by carefully measuring and guarding
themselves in most interactions, let's live by granting each other the lives we
really want and spend most of our time on life's greatest rewards.

### The plan is straightforward: ###

Minimize and satisfy our basic needs, then invest our extra time and energy and
money by giving them away, freely. Life's grandest rewards come when we give
without conditions and without any expectation of return. But furthermore: with
a change in focus, all today's scarcity mindsets can be replaced with systems
that encourage even more giving, and we can starve out extractive institutions.

### How? ###

We start now, with whatever we can. Each person gives what they want to whomever
they want. We do not suggest this to anyone for any reason other than for their
own benefit. We start with small gifts, whatever is easily afforded, and we
expand them throughout our lives. We don't measure them, except maybe for our
own sense of accomplishment.

### Why? ###

Millenia of experience and tomes of philosophy point us to this way of living.
It can be practiced wherever we live, whether in the most cooperative community
or in the staunchest totalitarian or capitalist societies... in any situation,
it increases joy in the world and invests in our future. And hearts are the only
way to change the world permanently; no outside-in approach can.

There is a future where we humans live such that our struggles are for
achievement, self-mastery, and love... there are no more fear-based reactions,
there is no more violence. We attain that future along this path. It is an
essential part of any religious or political or economic approach that leads to
a fulfilling life and enlightened society.

What are the gifts you're offering?

Let's celebrate them!
