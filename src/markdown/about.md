### The goal is audacious: ###

Envision a world of cooperation and loving-kindness... a place where we are
able to achieve our highest potential... and then: let's get there by spending our
extra time by giving to that, freely.

Whereas most people interact by carefully guarding their time and money with
measurements, let's give without specific guarantees to people in that future
world -- ourselves included.

### The plan is straightforward: ###

Minimize and satisfy our basic needs, then invest our extra time and energy and
money by giving them away, freely, until that dominates money. Life's grandest
rewards come when we give without conditions and without any expectation of
return. But furthermore: with a change in focus, all today's scarcity mindsets
can be replaced with systems that encourage even more giving, and we can starve
out extractive institutions.

Commitments will always be important. Some measurements (eg. money) will be
important in some contexts. But the most important work we can do is not
measured, so let's minimize our accounting systems and grow a culture that
donates our work and our lives toward whatever satisfies our souls the most.

Although this seems simplistic or something we informally strive for already,
the majority of the world's attention is on money and giving is treated as an
extra. Money is treated a basic requirement, and most work is in trade for
money. Let's flip it to where we prioritize gifts... and go further: show how we
can run our lives on a "gifting economy".

### How? ###

We start now, with whatever we can. Each person gives what they want to whomever
they want. We do not suggest this to anyone for any reason other than for their
own benefit. We start with small gifts, whatever is easily afforded, and we
expand them throughout our lives. We don't measure them, except maybe for our
own sense of accomplishment.

In the meantime, we'll work out how to live whole lives based on gifts.

### Why? ###

Millenia of experience and tomes of philosophy point us to this way of living.
It can be practiced wherever we live, whether in the most cooperative community
or in the staunchest totalitarian or capitalist societies... in any situation,
it increases joy in the world and invests in our future. And hearts are the only
way to change the world permanently; no outside-in approach can.

There is a future where we humans live such that our struggles are for
achievement, self-mastery, and love... there are no more fear-based reactions,
there is no more violence. We attain that future along this path. It is an
essential part of any religious or political or economic approach that leads to
a fulfilling life and enlightened society.

So...

What are the gifts you're offering?

Let's celebrate & expand them!
