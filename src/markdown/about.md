### It starts with vision. ###




Picture a world of cooperation and loving-kindness... a place where we are able
to achieve our highest potential. Seriously: close your eyes, pause for just 3
breaths, and imagine that world.

Now that you've seen it in your mind: do you believe we can get there?

If so, you're already working on it, so let's recognize and celebrate that!
Everyone already gives what that can to their favorite people or causes. Some
are able to give more. We honor every bit that is given freely. Whereas many
people interact by carefully guarding their time and money with measurements and
trade, let's give unconditionally to people in that future world.

### The plan is straightforward. ###

First, keep that future in mind. We'll only get there if it's in our sights.

* That cannot be emphasized enough! It's easy to lose sight of our ideals as we
  deal with everyday needs and with the people immediately around us. Part of
  our work is focused on the focus, keeping our highest goals in our sights.

Now we invest our extra time and energy and money by giving them away, freely,
until that dominates money.

* Life's grandest rewards come from gifts without conditions, and without any
  expectation of return. We emphasize those rewards.

* But the impact goes beyond what we can see: with a change in focus, all
  today's scarcity mindsets will be replaced with systems that encourage even
  more giving, and we will starve out extractive institutions.

Some measurements (eg. money) will remain useful in many contexts. But the most
important work we can do is unexpected and is not measured, so let's minimize
our accounting systems and grow a culture that donates our work and our lives
toward whatever satisfies our souls the most. Let's flip the script on today's
trade-oriented world to one where we prioritize gifts... and go further: let's
show how we can run our lives on a "gifting economy".

### How? ###

We start now, wherever we are in life and in the world.

Again, the vision comes first; just keeping it in mind will affect your actions,
and communicating it to others will make it even more real.

In terms of action:

* Raise awareness of the time and talents that are already being given, from
  cooking and cleaning to going above-and-beyond with family, friends, and
  organizations. This site has suggestions for ways to record and recognize
  these.

* Find where you would gain the most satisfaction and give there, filling the
  well of your soul. We suggest some places to reach out even further if you are
  still looking for that project that excites you.

* One of our initial goals is to supply someone's basic needs entirely with
  gifts, so if you're interested in the mechanics of this large-scale project
  then look for that project and reach out to us.

### Is it even possible? ###

This isn't merely philosophy or fun ideas: communities have lived this way
before, and simple bad social leadership has pushed us into a world where we
live with high levels of indebtedness and uncertainty. We will refocus. We will
practice this wherever we live, whether in the most cooperative community or in
the staunchest totalitarian or capitalist societies... in any situation, we will
increase joy in the world and invest in our future. Hearts are the only way to
change the world permanently; no outside-in or system-oriented approach can.

There is a future where we humans live such that our struggles are for
achievement, self-mastery, and love... there are no more fear-based reactions,
there is no more violence, even in the face of natural catastrophes. This is one
ingredient to attaining that future. This is an essential part of any religious
or political or economic approach that leads to a fulfilling life and
enlightened society. And it works well with all the other great initiatives
pushing along this path.

So...

What are the gifts you're offering?

Let's celebrate & expand them!
