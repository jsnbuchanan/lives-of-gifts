title: About This Idea
---

It's simple: many people are able to invest some of their time or energy or
money or all of the above, and it's incredibly rewarding when we give without
condition or expectation of return.

What each person gives is totally up to them, and this is not an approach to ask
of others for any other reason than to benefit themselves and the world in
general. It is not to be measured, except maybe by individuals for their own
sense of accomplishment.

There are millenia of experience and tomes of philosophy pointing us to this way
of living. It can be done and will reward practitioners anywhere: whether in the
most enlightened community or in the strictest totalitarian or capitalist
societies... and the great thing is that anyone in the latter is making headway
on getting to the former.

There is a future where we humans live such that our struggles are for
achievement, and there are no more fights out of fear nor violence against one
another. We attain that future along this path.
