title: About This Idea
---

It's simple: after basic needs, we put our time and energy (and money) into
extra areas, and it's one of life's best rewards when we give without condition
or expectation of return.

What each person gives is totally up to them... this is not something to ask of
others for any reason other than for their own benefit. The gifts are not to be
measured, except maybe by individuals for their own sense of accomplishment.
They start small, whatever is easily afforded, and they grow throughout our
lives.

Millenia of experience and tomes of philosophy point us to this way of living.
It can be done and will reward practitioners wherever they live, whether in the
most enlightened community or in the staunchest totalitarian or capitalist
societies... and the great thing is that those practicing in the latter are
making headway on changing their world into the former.

There is a future where we humans live such that our struggles are for
achievement, self-mastery, and love... there are no more fear-driven reactions,
no physical or emotional violence. We attain that future along this path.
