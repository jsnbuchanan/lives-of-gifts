It's simple: after basic needs, we put our time and energy and money into extra
areas. Let's grow those investments by giving it away, freely. First of all, one
of life's grandest rewards is when we give without conditions and without any
expectation of return. But furthermore, all today's scarcity mindsets can be
replaced with systems that encourage even more giving, and we can starve out
extractive institutions.

How? We start today. Each person gives what they want to whomever they want. We
do not suggest this to anyone for any reason other than for their own benefit.
We start with small gifts, whatever is easily afforded, and we expand them
throughout our lives. We don't measure them, except maybe for our own sense of
accomplishment.

Why? Millenia of experience and tomes of philosophy point us to this way of
living. It can be practiced wherever we live, whether in the most cooperative
community or in the staunchest totalitarian or capitalist societies... in any
situation, it increases joy in the world and invests in our future. And hearts
are the only way to change the world permanently; no outside-in approach can.

There is a future where we humans live such that our struggles are for
achievement, self-mastery, and love... there are no more fear-based reactions,
there is no more violence. We attain that future along this path. It is an
essential part of any religious or political or economic approach that leads to
a fulfilling life and enlightened society.

What are the gifts you're offering?

Let's celebrate them!
