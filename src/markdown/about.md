title: About This Idea
---

It's simple: after basic needs, we put our time and energy (and money) into
extra areas, and it's one of life's grandest rewards when we give without
conditions and without any expectation of return.

What each person gives is totally up to them... this is not something to ask of
others for any reason other than for their own benefit. Our gifts start small,
whatever is easily afforded, and they grow throughout our lives. They are not to
be measured, except maybe by individuals for their own sense of accomplishment.

Millenia of experience and tomes of philosophy point us to this way of living.
It can be practiced wherever we live, whether in the most enlightened community
or in the staunchest totalitarian or capitalist societies... in any situation,
it increases joy in the world.

There is a future where we humans live such that our struggles are for
achievement, self-mastery, and love... there are no more fear-driven reactions,
no physical or emotional violence. We attain that future along this path.
