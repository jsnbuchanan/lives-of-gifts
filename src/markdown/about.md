### It starts with vision. ###

Picture a world of cooperation and loving-kindness... a place where we are
able to achieve our highest potential. Do you believe we can get there?

If so, join us by spending your extra time by giving to that, freely. Whereas
most people interact by carefully guarding their time and money with
measurements, let's give without specific guarantees to people in that future
world -- ourselves included.

### The plan is straightforward. ###

First, keep that future in mind. We'll only get there if it's in our sights.

Then minimize and satisfy our basic needs, and invest our extra time and energy
and money by giving them away, freely, until that dominates money. Life's
grandest rewards come when we give without conditions and without any
expectation of return. But furthermore: with a change in focus, all today's
scarcity mindsets can be replaced with systems that encourage even more giving,
and we can starve out extractive institutions.

Commitments will always be important. Some measurements (eg. money) will be
important in some contexts. But the most important work we can do is not
measured, so let's minimize our accounting systems and grow a culture that
donates our work and our lives toward whatever satisfies our souls the most.

Although this seems simplistic or something we informally strive for already,
the majority of the world's attention is on money and giving is treated as an
extra. Money is treated a basic requirement, and most work is in trade for
money. Let's flip the script to where we prioritize gifts... and go further:
show how we can run our lives on a "gifting economy".

### How? ###

We start now, wherever we are in life and in the world.

Again, the vision comes first; just keeping it in mind will affect your actions,
and communicating it to others will make it even more real.

In terms of action, each person gives what they want to whomever they want. We
do not suggest this to anyone for any reason other than for their own benefit.
We start with small gifts, whatever is easily afforded, and we expand them
throughout our lives. We don't measure them, except maybe for our own sense of
accomplishment.

Before long, we'll work out how to live whole lives based on gifts.

### Is it even possible? ###

This isn't just philosophy or fun ideas: communities have lived this way
before, and it's only a shift in values and bad examples that have pushed us
into a world where we live with high levels of indebtedness and uncertainty. We
can refocus. We can practice this wherever we live, whether in the most
cooperative community or in the staunchest totalitarian or capitalist
societies... in any situation, we can increases joy in the world and invest in
our future. And hearts are the only way to change the world permanently; no
outside-in or system-oriented approach can.

There is a future where we humans live such that our struggles are for
achievement, self-mastery, and love... there are no more fear-based reactions,
there is no more violence. We attain that future along this path. It is an
essential part of any religious or political or economic approach that leads to
a fulfilling life and enlightened society. And it works well with whatever are
the other great initiatives pushing along this path.

So...

What are the gifts you're offering?

Let's celebrate & expand them!
