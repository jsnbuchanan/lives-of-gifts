It's always nice to receive recognition. (It's even nicer to give it, so take every opportunity to thank people, even for random things at random times!)

Although we don't want to brag about what we've done, it lifts us up when we can remind ourselves that others have appreciated something about us. So here is a way to semi-publicly give and receive thanks: go to the [Endorser.ch](https://endorser.ch) app and choose a friend in your network and mention something positive that they've done. Maybe others will even agree... and the receipient has a cryptographically signed record, being an irrefutable reminder of inspiration.
