When were you last recognized for something you've done? Take that energy and pour it into someone else... a few words will be remembered for a long time.

Here is another way to semi-publicly give and receive thanks: go to the [EndorserSearch.org](https://endorsersearch.org) app and choose a friend in your network and mention something positive that they've done. Maybe others will even agree... and the receipient has a cryptographically signed record, being an irrefutable reminder of inspiration.

One more suggestion, all for yourself: when you take time daily to express your
gratitude and/or journal your life, also mention one thing that you contributed
today. Regular affirmations magnify your awareness!
