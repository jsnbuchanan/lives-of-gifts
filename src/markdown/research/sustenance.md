In Utah, the [Terraculture Project](https://www.terracultureproject.org/) demonstrates healthy ways of living with minimal effort, as naturally as possible. We have started construction and there are many ways to help. It is affiliated with The Bridge non-profit, where we will start experiments with local food production.

We also work with [ShareBay](https://sharebay.org) to build a giving society.
