What would you like help with, or how can you help in other projects? Let's get
better at coordination: advertise anything you want to do, or pledge help to
others along with any conditions... maybe it's only worthwhile if half-a-dozen
more people join or if someone commits to a certain amount of time. Kids are
especially good at getting participation, and we can encourage even more growth
when they learn to better communicate and solicit help with their interests. We
are starting with privacy-preserving technology: publishing
[projects](/projects), designing [shared data
schemas](https://endorser.ch/doc/html/transactions.html), and showing
[visualizations](https://observablehq.com/d/83a90a6d6cd11999).
