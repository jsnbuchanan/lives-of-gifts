What would you like help with, or how can you help in other projects? Let's get
better at coordination: advertise what we want to do or can do, along with any
conditions... maybe it's only worthwhile if half-a-dozen more people join, or if
someone commits to a certain period of time. Kids are especially good at getting
participation, and we can encourage even more growth when they learn to better
communicate and solicit help with their interests. We are starting with
privacy-preserving technology, designing [shared data
schemas](https://endorser.ch/doc/html/transactions.html) and
[visualizations](https://observablehq.com/d/83a90a6d6cd11999), and we can use
help with testing as well as development.
