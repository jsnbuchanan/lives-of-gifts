Everyone can learn... and they gain even more by teaching. Any person who can
speak and act has something to share. In a community, everyone benefits, even
lurkers: they may learn something, or they may make a connection with someone
with the same interests. One experiment is [Enlighten Bountiful
Night](https://enlightenbountiful.org) where local, in-person events encourage a
variety of participation.
