Everyone can learn, and everyone can teach. In a community, everyone benefits,
even lurkers: they may learn something, or they may make a connection with
someone with the same interests... all on the way to becoming performers and
teachers themselves. One incarnation is [Enlighten Bountiful
Night](https://enlightenbountiful.org) where local, in-person events encourage a
variety of participation.
