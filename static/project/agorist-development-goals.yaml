- Goal 1 - Promote access to non-state-funded forms of education that emphasize voluntaryism, self-ownership, mutual aid, critical thinking, creativity, and self-directed learning.

- Goal 2 - Foster the creation of a network of homeschooling co-ops, unschooling pods, worldschooling advocates, and forest school proponents, whose services can be easily accessed by parents in need.

- Goal 3 - Create localized and decentralized food systems through community gardens and food forests, and connecting communities with local food producers. This can be accomplished by making knowledge of permaculture and indigenous food systems more readily available to the masses.

- Goal 4 - Create pesticide- and GMO-free zones where communities can practice agriculture without fear of contamination from genetically-engineered technology and toxins.

- Goal 5 - Promote digital privacy education and encryption tools. Encourage and support access to these tools.

- Goal 6 - Defund the corporations, banks, philanthropic foundations, and governments, which are the true causes of the destruction of the planet â€“ its people, wildlife, and ecosystems. This could be achieved through mass boycott and divestment campaigns coordinated by grassroots organizations around the world.

- Goal 7 - Support and promote the use of alternative (digital and paper) currencies. The heart of our current predicament is economic enslavement in a system based on debt and the forced use of state-backed fiat money. Thus, every person should have access to the currency of his or her choice.

- Goal 8 - Protect the right of all people to access land. Protect the right to harvest rainwater, solar energy, and other resources that allow individuals to become self-sustaining.

- Goal 9 - Promote a new standard of optimal human health by fostering dialogue about practices and modalities that have been maligned or made illegal by governments. Encourage an honest debate on the benefits of a range of diets and lifestyles while respecting individual choices.

- Goal 10 - Build human settlements that foster empowerment, community, resiliency, and innovation. Create communities free of exposure to harmful environmental toxins, including, but not limited to, electromagnetic frequency radiation, GMOs, aerosols, pesticides, nanotechnology, etc.
